Concept Used:

The entire circuit is build in the concept of input and output. We give an input and according to it the circuits gives an output in the 
form of flashing of LED. The LED flashes according to the instruction uploaded in the Arduino board. The board is equipped with sets of 
digital and analog input and output pins. All the instruction executed by the board are given to it using a program written in C 
programming language. For This experiment we use digital pin 13 as output. The positive terminal of the LED is connected to the digital pin 
13 and the negative terminal is connected to the ground of the Arduino board.

Learning & Observation:

During performing this experiment, I became familiar with obtaining random numbers and working RGB light.

Problem Troubleshooting:

I encountered the problem in my code only that the code wasn't working as expected. So, I re-examined the code and corrected it.

Precautions:

Make sure you correctly select the board and port in the "Tools" option in Arduino software.
Handle the Arduino board carefully as a simple damage can made the hardware useless.
Keep in mind that you should write program that is small in size as it came with low inbuilt memory.
Carefully connect a resistor to the LED or it will get damaged on working.

Learning Outcomes:

Trough this experiment I came to learn about the Arduino board and working of it. Now I can also do more advance things.
